# DISCLAIMER

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS SCRIPT.

THIS SCRIPT IS MADE FOR AUDITORS / PENTESTERS IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME BEFORE ADVANCED STEPS DURING PENTETRATION TESTS.

BY USING THIS SCRIPT YOU UNDERSTAND AND ARE RESPONSIBLE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THINGS GOES WRONG.

# DESCRIPTION
Shortly : This script gives you the first picture of a machine that you want to analyse.

Thanks to nmap, xerXes.sh discovers services and their potentials weaknesses on a targeted machine. 

It enumerates for you directories on a web server and open in a Firefox browser if directories found.

It creates local directory and stores reports inside. It is a script so that's why reports are also supposed to be checked if some informations are missing.


By the way, if some use cases are missing, or working wired, please let me know.

I have lot of ideas to improve the script, but missing time by those days. 

Thanks to using it and have fun on CTF machines !
