Thanks to nmap, xerXes.sh discovers services and their potentials weaknesses on a targeted machine with searchsploit. 
It enumerates for you directories on a web server and open in a firefox browser directories found.
It stores reports. It is a script and repports are supposed to be checked if some informations are missing.
Shortly : it simplify your tests

By the way, if some cases of utilisation are missing, or working wired, please let me know.

I have lot of ideas to improve the script, but missing time those days. 

Thanks to using it and have fun on CTF machines !

USAGE :
./xerXes.sh $ip $machineName

$ip is the IP address of the targeted machine
$machineName is the name of directories and files created for a good organisation of repports
